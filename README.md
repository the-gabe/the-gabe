# Who are you?

I work on a lot. This GitHub profile doesn't really articulate that very well.

On Github, I primarily maintain the [AdapptOnAzure](https://github.com/AdapptOnAzure) organisation, where we host tooling we work on and maintain at Adappt for Azure environments we maintain.

I am just a person that is really interested in SIGINT, enjoys working on cloud engineering, low level OS internals, firmware implants, digital tradecraft, and is the kind of person who compiles their entire OS because they have been traumatized by the horrors of supply chain security. I'm currently researching X86 hypervisors in my spare time.

# Predictions for the year

My bleak 2025 prediction is that we will see a large increase in major state sponsored attacks on critical infrastructure by attacking weakpoints in the global supply chain of both software and hardware, with real world kinetic and digital implications. You saw it here first.
